**Luhn algorithm** is a simple check digit formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers.
The purpose is to design a numbering scheme in such a way that when a human is entering a number, a computer can quickly check it for errors.
The Luhn algorithm is used in a variety of systems, including: _Credit Cart Numbers, IMEI Numbers, ICCID of SIM cards, etc._
